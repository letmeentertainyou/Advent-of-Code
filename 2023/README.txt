This is my first time publishing my Advent of Code answers. I'm publishing them to hold myself
accountable. I'm hoping to finish this year. I always start strong and then get overwhelmed about
halfway through. But this year I have access to a lot of study resources so I think I'll finish.

If you are looking for Advent of Code answers and somehow you landed here then this is what you need
to know. Each day is in it's own numbered folder. Each folder contains the following files:
 * part_1.py
 * part_2.py 

I will do my best to include doc strings in every function and add helpful comments. In general
this will have far less documentation than my other github projects.

Every solution will be inside of a python function called either part_1 or part_2 with the input
file's name as the only argument. I may need to write additional Python functions for some problems
those will be in the appropriate python files.

I have worked with a few languages on my github but I am most comfortable with Python, and I like
using it for munging data. While I could write my solutions in other languages I would end up
spending most of my time reimplementing things like reverse() or set() and I'd rather just solve the
problems. If you like one of my solutions you should be able to copy the logic over easily enough
within your own tool chain. (Special shout out to my Rustaceans out there!)



*** NOTE: While I have typed hinted a fair bit of this project I am not using the types that you need to
import such as :List and :Tuple. This is because my system uses python3.8 and frankly I'd rather not confuse 
which computers can use my code any further than necessary.

If you are using python3.10 then you can use :list and :tuple as valid type hints but it will break on
older python versions.
